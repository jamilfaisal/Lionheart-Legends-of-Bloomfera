# Lionheart-Legends-of-Bloomfera
Text-adventure game using HTML, CSS, javascript, and jQuery!

(24/1/2017) 
-	This game has been built from scratch. Html, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery files were all created with no base.
-	The game and plot are heavily inspired by the board-game Dungeons & Dragons.
-	The game might not be as complicated as Iâ€™d hoped and is definitely far from perfect. However, the basic elements such as adding text and battle engine have been done, allowing any future updates to be done more quickly.
-	Most of the code contains comments even though some are repeated.
